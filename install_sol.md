# Install Sol

Let's start off with getting sol ready. Head over to the [Sol](https://github.com/sol-lang/sol) repository on Github and either download a zip file of it or use ```git clone```.

Open up the directory and run the Makefile with ```make```. This should download any dependencies and begin compiling Sol. If it is successful, you should have a ./Solace executable. Now you can either begin writing sol and running programs or using the interpreter.
