sol [<options> [<arg> [<arg> ...]]]

Sol Executive - compiles and/or runs a Sol program.

Options given to Sol are given via the first argument. For options that take
parameters, they are read in the order specified in the option argument; e.g.,
"./sol ab a.foo b.bar" and "./sol ba b.bar a.foo" are equivalent, assuming
options "a" and "b" take arguments.

Sol currently recognizes the following options:

-d: Sets yydebug=1, which enables debug tracing of the parser/lexer.
-D: Sets debugging within the language runtime itself.
-t: Prints the Sol syntax tree after program loading.
-i: Ignore any initialization files. See the information below for the
 initialization files this version of Sol is compiled to use.
-r <file>: Read the program from the file, instead of the default (stdin).
 Programs run this way have access to stdin via `io.stdin` in the global
 environment.
-c <file>: After loading the program, write bytecode to the file, instead of
 running the program. Such files can be later loaded using the C option.
-C: Assume that the program file is a compiled bytecode stream instead of Sol
 source text.

Sol's exit status is determined by the following, in this order:
- 0, on printing this help;
- 2, if an argument, parsing, or initialization error occurred;
- 0, if the file was to be compiled and was written successfully;
- 1, if the program in the file encountered an error at the top level;
- the integer value if an integer was returned at the top level;
- 0 otherwise.

For more information about the language itself, please refer to the source
repository and/or `make docs` therein.
